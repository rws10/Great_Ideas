Here is a list of items that need to be done to finish the project:
ADDITIONS
- Make it work for IE
- Make the entire button work for clicking action
- Force titles to be unique
 * This has been done. I would like the error message to line up with the title and text box displays. 
   Also, the data with the error will still be populated there if you go "back to index" and immediately go back to create new.
   However, if you repeat the same process, it will then be gone.
- Change "approved" to "added"
- Have the files that are ready to be uploaded listed by name
- Have the ability to delete uploaded files from the edit page
- Make "create new" button smaller on Homepage
- Make the ideas and comments exist in a paged list. limit perhaps to 10 per page? Adjustable limit?
- Add a contact us link on the homepage
- Add Filterby choice of archived and project submission
- Add Javascript to update page when "FilterBy:" choice is made
- Make "Search By:" boxes instead of radio buttons
- Add in the time sensitive auto-actions
- Integrate Active Directory
- Add Meta to check for viruses
- Get server access
  - In progress. ITLC papers submitted. Waiting on approval.
BUGS
- Can submit the same idea more than once. Possible to spam click "create new" 
  and create numerous copies of the idea.

Looks:
Overall:
- Squeeze everything into the center of the page more. Will discuss how much
- Whitespace above emblem on the entrance page and Home

Idea:
-multiple:
  - Add space between the name of the attachment and the download link
-index:
  - have the approval button only appear if the status is set to submitted.
  - have the text box around the description fit vertically closer to the text itself.

- details:
  - cut the description text box size to about half the page before it wraps the text.
  - (do this last. not very important) add a link to view the comments next to "Back to list"

- edit: 
  - make the status into a dropdown with only the choices descriped in the model.

Comment:
- index:
  - When the comment index is called for an idea, the URL is populated with the attributes of the idea. 
      Any large body of an idea will cause an error.
- edit:
  - Have the "Back to List" button take the user back to the comments index
  - Have the body display like the body of the ideas.
- delete:
  - Have the "Back to List" button take the user back to the comments index
