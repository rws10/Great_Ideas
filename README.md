# Team_Zed
Here are a list of tips and such the project.

Desired (non critical) Functions:
- Have a page that will list all of the ideas with a specific status code. 
  (e.g. all of the ideas with a status of "Submitted")
- Have a page to view own submitted ideas.
- Search Functions
- Approval page
  - Base view page should be an edit page. However, instead of being able to edit the title and description, they should just be shown as is.
    There will be radio buttons. One says approve, the other says deny. Deny will make the the text box below it required. 
	This text box will be what fills in the "Reason for Denial" attribute. See the form example in the Requirements in the dropbox for a visual example.
- Email
- Time sensitive auto-actions
- Admins having the ability to change the status of ideas to archived, active, and project submission
