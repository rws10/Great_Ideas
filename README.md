Here is a list of items that need to be done to finish the project:
ADDITIONS

Alex:
- On the comments delete page:
- Add a view for handling unhandled exceptions. 
  * Reference what I did on the IdeaController/create Post for db.Savechanges().
- See about integrating "Logfor Net"
  * This is a log for occurences on the site. Good for when unhandled exceptions occur.

- Follow ADA Format
 * Label on name on form
- Have the attachments that are ready to be uploaded listed by name
- Add in the time sensitive auto-actions

Russell:
Idea:
-index: 
 - Have the body show the first 5 lines and then have the rest hidden in a "show more" type container.
   Then, accordian the rest of the idea out on clicking "show more"

Comment:
- index:
  - When the comment index is called for an idea, the URL is populated with the attributes of the idea. 
      * Any large body of an idea will cause an error.

BUGS


Future Updates:
- Allow users to cancel uploading a document. Once a file has been selected using the "browse" 
  button, they are locked into uploading at least one file
- Add a new field of "Project Manager"
  - This will be filled out on the Active Project. It will be required when submitting for Active Project.
  - Send email to PPMO Support about the idea becoming a project.
- Add a configuration page to adjust background settings
  - i.e. length of time that passes before a denied idea is removed.
- Add the ability to search by name
- Add a page to make deleting multiple ideas?

Downloaded NuGet Packages:
- PagedList.Mvc
- log4net
